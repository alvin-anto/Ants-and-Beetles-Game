# Ants-and-Beetles-Game
This project simulates a game board containing two types of creatures: ants and beetles. Ants and beetles have different behaviors, which are implemented in the derived classes Ant and Beetle inherited from the base class Creature. The simulation runs in a game board (2D grid) where ants and beetles move, breed, and interact with each other.
